# read in data
ccomp <- read_csv("data/in2020_v08_samples.csv")

```{r catch comp}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
